 occitania.2.d:0 "Under secretive circumstances, leaders of the various banned political parties met to discuss an temporary coalition against the totalitarian government. United, we may have a larger chance of taking down the oppresive and absolute rule of Emanuel Sarrot."
 occitania.3.d:0 "In accordance to Emanuel Sarrot's orders, the Occitan 2nd Army crossed the river Rhone into the demilitarised zone, effectively ending the 18 year demilitarisation. While this is a huge victory of the Occitan state and can expect to reap the benefits in the following years, it is expected that the Lombard state will not be so enthusiastic to the remilitarisation along its border."
