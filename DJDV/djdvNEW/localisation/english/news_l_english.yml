 remilitarisation_rhoneland:0 "At 2:00 pm today, 40000 Occitan soldiers marched into the Rhoneland, near the Alps of Savoy, which has been demilitarised since the Treaty of Berlin to serve as protection for the Lombards. Diplomatic reactions of former members of the victorious Quadrumvirate seem disinterested and avoidant of the situation, likely due to failing economic conditions and the rise of political violence globally.\n\nCheering crowds have been reported, especially in Marseilles as trucks and troops marched through La Canebière."
